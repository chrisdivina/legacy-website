          <h3 class="portfolio-title">The Culture Trip</h3>
          <p class="portfolio-desc">I joined <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/" target="_blank">The Culture Trip</a> in its early days, when it was a very small startup. They needed someone to look after their website to please their rapidily increasing number of visitors, and to smooth the editorial process. As the <strong>Head of UX & Front-End Development</strong>, I was in charge to revamp the whole website, migrate 10,000+ articles from an XML-based CMS to a Wordpress database, as well as create several tools to improve the editorial production workflow.</p>
